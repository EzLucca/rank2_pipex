# Project PIPEX
## Objective
This project focuses on handling pipes.
## Functions allowed
üß∞ File & I/O Operations
- open: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.

- close: Closes an open file descriptor.

- read: Reads data from a file descriptor into a buffer.

- write: Writes data from a buffer to a file descriptor.

- access: Checks a file‚Äôs accessibility (read/write/execute/existence).

- unlink: Deletes a name from the filesystem (removes a file).

üß† Memory Management
- malloc: Allocates memory dynamically from the heap.

- free: Deallocates memory previously allocated by malloc.

üêõ Error Handling
- perror: Prints a system error message based on errno.

- strerror: Returns a string describing an error code.

üîÅ File Descriptor Manipulation
- dup: Duplicates a file descriptor to the lowest available number.

- dup2: Duplicates a file descriptor to a specific target number.

üîß Process Control
- execve: Replaces current process image with a new executable.

- exit: Terminates the current process and returns a status.

- fork: Creates a new process by duplicating the current one.

- pipe: Creates a unidirectional data channel for interprocess communication.

- wait: Waits for any child process to terminate.

- waitpid: Waits for a specific child process to terminate.

## Tasklist
- [x] Validation - number of arguments; 
- [ ] Validation - infile exists and have the correct permissions; using access
- [ ] Parsing - take the enviromental path; 
- [ ] Parsing - split enviromental path; 
- [ ] Parsing - find the correct path of the command; 

## Commands
The following command will show all the system calls happening.
```
strace -f -e trace=process,write,read bash -c 'cat file.txt | grep "error"'
```
`pstree` shows all the process in a tree format
```
pstree
```
For gdb debugging
```
set follow-fork-mode child
```
```
strace -e trace=process,file,desc ./pipex <args>
```
